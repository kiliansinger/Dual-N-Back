Dual-N-Back Game
======

Play it online at [https://kiliansinger.github.io/Dual-N-Back/](https://kiliansinger.github.io/Dual-N-Back/).
Cloned from https://www.dual-n-back.io/ and translated to German letters.

Based on the task originally proposed by [1], and adapted by [2]. Dual N-Back has been shown to improve working memory over time. For more information see [3] and [4].

## Instructions
The goal of each level is to remember the state of the game exactly N timesteps ago.

The game board is a set of eight squares. They will flash in a random order, at three seconds intervals. When you recognize that the same square flashed exactly N steps ago, you press the   button.

Simultaneously, one letter is spoken at each time step. When you recognize that the same letter was spoken exactly N steps ago, you press the   button.

**Example sequence for N=2 game.** The player must remember the state of the game board N steps ago. If you do well, N will increase on the next round. If you don't do so well, N will decrease on the next round (down to N=1). There are 20+N time steps in each round.
